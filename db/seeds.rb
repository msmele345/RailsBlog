# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
require 'faker'


# 10.times do
#   user = {:name => Faker::Internet.user_name, :email => Faker::Internet.email, :password => 'password'}

#   User.create!(user)
# end

# 10.times do
#   comment = {:name => Faker::Hipster.word , :body => Faker::Hipster.sentence, :user_id => rand(1..10), :post_id => rand(1..10)}

#   Comment.create!(comment)
# end


# 10.times do
#   post = {:title => Faker::Hipster.sentence(2), :body => Faker::Hipster.paragraph, :user_id => rand(1..10)}

#   Post.create!(post)
